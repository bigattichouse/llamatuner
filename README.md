# llamatune

Find good `llama.cpp` command-line parameters for a given GGUF model **on your
machine**, automatically, using a [Taguchi orthogonal-array](taguchi/) sweep
over `llama-bench`. The Taguchi engine (and its Morris/Sobol siblings) comes from
the [`robust`](https://github.com/bigattichouse/robust) DOE suite, vendored here as
a git submodule.

You point it at a model; it figures out the hardware, runs a small, statistically
designed set of benchmarks, and hands you paste-ready `llama-server` commands for
the **fastest**, the **longest-context**, and the **best-balanced** configuration —
plus the full speed-vs-context Pareto frontier.

```bash
# plan only — prints the experiment matrix and commands, uses NO GPU
python3 llamatuner.py /path/to/model.gguf

# actually run the sweep (uses the GPU)
python3 llamatuner.py /path/to/model.gguf --run

# bigger, finer sweep
python3 llamatuner.py /path/to/model.gguf --run --array L125
```

## Why Taguchi instead of a full sweep?

The knobs that matter for llama.cpp throughput interact, and testing every
combination explodes fast. With 5 factors at 5 levels each, a full factorial is
`5^5 = 3125` benchmark runs. A Taguchi **L25** orthogonal array estimates every
factor's main effect in **25 runs** — a >99% reduction — while keeping the levels
balanced so each factor's effect can be read independently.

We use the vendored `robust`/`taguchi` library via its Python binding to generate
the runs and to compute main effects. The `robust` suite also ships `morris` and
`sobol` binaries for the wider screening funnel (see Roadmap).

## What it tunes

Five factors, five levels each (auto-scaled to your hardware and model):

| Factor        | llama-bench flag | Levels (example, Qwen3.6-27B on MI50) | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| GPU layers    | `-ngl`           | `0, 16, 32, 48, 64`                    | biggest lever; top = model's real layer count |
| Context depth | `-d` (n-depth)   | `0, 4096, 16384, 32768, 65536`         | KV pre-fill; the speed-vs-context axis |
| CPU threads   | `-t`             | `4, 6, 8, 12, 16`                      | auto-derived around the physical-core count |
| KV cache type | `-ctk`/`-ctv`    | `f16, q8_0, q5_1, q4_1, q4_0`          | quantizing the KV cache buys context |
| Micro-batch   | `-ub`            | `128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048`            | prefill/decode balance |

**Fixed** (not swept): `-fa 1` (flash-attention on — a near-certain win on gfx906
and a *precondition* for quantized KV cache), `-mmp 1` (mmap on), `-b 2048` (batch
fixed to avoid invalid `batch < ubatch` combinations).

L25 has 6 columns; using 5 factors leaves **one spare column** as an error/variance
estimate that flags when the additive main-effects model is breaking down.

---

## What it measures

For each config, `llama-bench` reports two throughput numbers, both captured:

- **`tg_tps`** — token-generation t/s (decode speed; what you feel interactively).
  This is what the optimizer maximizes.
- **`pp_tps`** — prompt-processing t/s (prefill speed; matters for long-context/RAG).
  Reported alongside.

Runs that **OOM, crash, or time out** are recorded as data (`tg=0`, with a status of
`OOM`/`ERROR`/`TIMEOUT`) rather than aborting the sweep. High context depth at low
`-ngl` with an `f16` KV cache is *expected* to OOM — that failure is the memory cliff
we're mapping, not a bug.

---

## Auto-detection

The tool inspects the box and the model so you don't hand-tune the factor levels:

- **Physical / logical cores** — unique `(physical id, core id)` pairs from
  `/proc/cpuinfo` (fallback: `logical / 2`). Thread levels bracket the physical-core
  count, where llama.cpp throughput usually peaks.
- **VRAM** — via `rocm-smi` (best-effort; informational).
- **Model layer count** — a minimal, dependency-free GGUF metadata reader parses
  `<arch>.block_count` from the header (no tensors loaded), so `-ngl`'s top level is
  the model's real layer count.

---

## Output

```
### FASTEST (max t/s)
  tg=… t/s  pp=… t/s  depth=…  ngl=…  t=…  kv=…  ub=…
  suggested llama-server command:
    ./llama-server -m model.gguf -ngl … -t … -c … -ctk … -ctv … -ub … -b 2048 -fa 1

### BALANCED (max t/s with context >= 16384)
  …

### LONGEST CONTEXT
  …

### Pareto frontier (context vs t/s)
  depth=  4096  tg=…  ngl=…  kv=…  ub=…
  depth= 16384  tg=…  …
  …

### Taguchi main effects (tg t/s, higher = better)
  <per-factor level means + which factors dominate>
  Predicted-optimal levels: {…}
```

Full per-run data is written to `results.csv`.

### Reading the results correctly

- **Trust the Pareto frontier and the raw `results.csv`** for the actual
  recommendation — those read measured numbers directly.
- **Use the main-effects table to rank which knobs matter**, not as gospel for the
  single best config. Because OOM is scored as `0 t/s` and is driven by an
  *interaction* (the `ngl × n_depth × kv_type` memory budget), the additive
  main-effects model can misattribute an interaction to a main effect. This is why
  the recommendation is driven off the Pareto, and why we keep the spare column for
  an error estimate.

---

## Recommended workflow (staged)

1. **Screen** with **L25** (25 runs, ~30–40 min) to see which knobs dominate and get
   a candidate optimum.
2. **Refine** the 2–3 dominant factors with **L125** and map the context Pareto finely.
3. **Confirm** the predicted-optimal config with a direct `llama-server` run at your
   real context size (standard Taguchi discipline — verifies additivity held).

---

## Requirements

- `llama.cpp` built with ROCm/HIP for your GPU, at
  `../llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-bench` (override with `--llama-bench`).
- The `robust`/`taguchi` submodule, checked out and built:
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init          # fetch the robust DOE suite
  make -C taguchi                      # build libtaguchi.so (pure C, no GPU)
  ```
  `llamatuner` locates the Python binding automatically by searching the submodule.
- Python 3.10+ (uses `X | None` type syntax), standard library only.

---

## CLI reference

```
python3 llamatuner.py MODEL.gguf [options]

  --run              actually execute the sweep (default: plan/dry-run, no GPU)
  --array L25|L125   Taguchi array (default: L25)
  --ctx-floor N      minimum usable context for the BALANCED pick (default: 16384)
  --probe-ctx        after the sweep, binary-search the largest context that
                     loads for the fastest config (needs --run)
  --selftest         run offline logic checks and exit (no GPU, no model)
  --llama-bench PATH path to the llama-bench binary
  --timeout SECS     per-run timeout (default: 1200)
  --results PATH     results CSV output (default: results.csv)
```

Run `python3 llamatuner.py --selftest` to verify the JSON parser, OOM detection,
factor-level generation, MoE detection, and Pareto logic without a GPU or model.

## Implemented

- **MoE awareness** — detects `<arch>.expert_count` in GGUF metadata; if the model is
  MoE, promotes `-ncmoe` (CPU-offload of experts) to a swept factor (the biggest
  RAM/VRAM lever on MoE). If dense, keeps the spare L25 column for error estimation.
- **Max-context probe** (`--probe-ctx`) — after the sweep, binary-searches the largest
  context that loads for the fastest config, capped at the model's native context.
- **Offline self-test** (`--selftest`) — verifies the core logic without a GPU.

## Roadmap / ideas

- **Flash-attn as an outer block** — run the array twice (`-fa 0` / `-fa 1`) to
  quantify flash-attention's effect directly, mindful that quantized KV requires
  `-fa 1`.
- **Morris/Sobol pre-screen** — the vendored `robust` suite ships `morris` and `sobol`
  binaries. Use Morris to screen which factors matter (μ\* importance, σ interaction
  flag) before committing to the full Taguchi bench, and Sobol for variance/interaction
  attribution when L25's error estimate says the additive model is shaky.
